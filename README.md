Mojave mine craft resource pack for Minecraft BE
## Features

This resource pack changes every possible things to what OITSWILLIAM wants.

- Replaces default font with the custom-made font (except the full-width ones).
- Replaces UI elements sounds,
- For some reason I do like to tamper some blocks sounds (from blocks.json).
- Replaces pop-up notification sound using FitnessGram Pacer Test sound effect,
- Replace iron helmet with R4R, and diamond helmet with R4R with hat,
- and replaces the Minecraft logo too.

The following features that needs to reconfigure the pack from the options:
- Replace player hurt sound with Tesla warning sound,
- Replace player death sound with sounds that are funny,
- Replace rabbit hurt sound to the same thing the player plays,
- Replace rabbit death sounds with the beginning of the Highway Section 2.

Currently, it has three options, replace UI elements only, play sounds from this resource pack and the "earrap" ear-hurting sounds mode (headphones NOT recommended).
